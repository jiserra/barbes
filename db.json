Rent parties, salons, NYC lofts, brothels, squeals and honks, musical feels, romantic melodicism -evocative beauty that cannot be ignored. This band, led by Canadian lap steel player Myk Freedman, is in love with the memories of memories, but it is 2019. People have been playing guitars using their kids’ broken dental appliances for decades. The music must take that into account, but Coleman Hawkins! Therein lies their circular mentality: they move forward, they move backward. They let a song out of their hearts, they scream down a well, think in cut-time, think out of time, joyfully get lost in the murk of innuendo.\n With Myk Freedman- lap steel/tunes; JP Shlegelmilch- piano; Jason Nazary- drums; Ari Folman-Cohen- bass and various surprise guests.",
